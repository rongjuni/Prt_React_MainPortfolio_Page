        <h3>MY STORY</h3>
        <p>
          I know what you are going to ask me if you have noticed the titles
          next to my name.... But yes. I want to be a developer dreadfully. I
          was a student who liked math and physics in middle and high school.
          When I had to pick a major at college, I was informed that
          "Accounting" would be the best choice for me since they are playing
          with numbers. I believed that until now as you see my license and
          additional degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I happend to experience some of SQL at current company to
          extract financial data, and it was really interesting. I decided to
          learn more and started studying other programming languages such as
          Javascript, React and NodeJS. It was enjoyable process. I enjoy time
          to deeply think. I even pay to purchase brain-teasing games to rack my
          brain but in developing environment, I can get unlimited number of
          brain-teasing tasks for FREE üòÅ.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I am in a career transition process, I am eager to learn more and
          willing to spend extra hours to study and contribute to a team. I am a
          fast learner and catch things quickly. Even though I do not have all
          the answers at the moment, I will make it happen and come up with
          solutions.
