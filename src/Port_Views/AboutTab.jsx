        <h3>MY STORY</h3>
        <p>
          I know what you are going to say.. And yes. I had to chagne because I
          like it much more. I chose accounting as a student who liked math and
          physics because I was informed that accounting is all math related
          field with high job security üòÅ.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I happend to experience some of SQL at work to pull out
          financial data and manipulate to the proper format that we needed. It
          was interesting. I started researching and started learning coding and
          immediately realized that it is what I was looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy time focusing on things and thinking deeply. I also enjoy
          brain teasing games like riddles or room-escaping in my freetime, and
          I like developing because it's free brain teasing game that I don't
          have to pay to App store or room escape.
